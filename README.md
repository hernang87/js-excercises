Using the `films.json` file located on the root of the repository:
1. Build a grid showing "Episode Number - Title" and in a new line the release date

3. Show the films in release order

## Second: Details

2. Once the content finishes scrolling up display a button so the user is prompted to be redirected to the details of the film
3. On each of the films' pages display:
    * Episode Number and film title
    * List of characters

## Third: Characters
1. Add a link in the filmsÂ´ details page for each of the characters to check their profile information
